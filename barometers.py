can use a generator object to produce the various values in python by comparing positionals without having to store them in arrays holy shit

dict { epoch, date, time, pressure, ABS generated (not sure exactly how without looking), with sign generated } 


# get locnumber from file name
# read in line by line
    # remove if empty value
    # if key time already exists in dict, skip it
    # (optionally - look at cache file as well and read it into dict first?)
    # sort dict keys (or read dict keys) by epoch key
# generator for ABS_val and SIGN_val (er, research that) and add to dict
# for last (user input?) entries, output the generated values
# graphics to output colored data (no idea yet)

list[ curr_value, [ list_of_abv[] ], [list of ] ]

access by 

list[1][3]


New calculation is 

C52-C51 C51-C50 C50-C49 C49-C48
|(1024-1025)|+|(1025-1026)|+|(1026-1025)|+|(1025-1024)|
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
without abs, gets you to 0.

timestamp. current pressure.  [ set of ABV(current pressure - interval back current pressure) ].  [ set of (current pressure - interval back current pressure) ]. \
